## Overview

The Link Roundup plugin allows you to:

- Curate links
- Create link roundup posts
- Optionally send the roundup posts to MailChimp to be distributed to your subscribers

It also includes two widgets:

- A widget to display your recently saved links
- A widget to display your recent link roundup posts (with the ability to limit by category)

The plugin includes a browser bookmark that you can drag to your browser's bookmark bar, allowing you to save links directly to your WordPress site. This bookmark attempts to pre-fill fields like link title, source, URL and featured image and also allows you to add a description to each link viewable when published on your site.

In its previous life, Link Roundups was called Argo Links.

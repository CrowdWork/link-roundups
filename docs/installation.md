# Installation

If you're an INN member making use of INN's [Largo Project](https://largoproject.org) hosting, the Link Roundups plugin is already installed. *Be sure to choose Link Roundups and not the now depricated argo-links plugin.*

## Manual Install

1. Download the [.zip archive](https://github.com/INN/link-roundups/archive/master.zip) from GitHub.
2. Extract the .zip archive. 
3. Rename the plugin directory to `link-roundups`. If the directory the plugin files reside is is named anything else, the plugin will not work.
4. Upload the plugin directory to you server's `wp-content/plugins` directory.
5. Activate the plugin through the [`Plugins` menu](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins_Screen) in WordPress.

## WordPress Plugin Directory or Your WordPress Dashboard

Coming Soon. Yes, exciting.

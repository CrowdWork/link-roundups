# Widgets

#### 1. Saved Links Widgets (since 0.1)

The Saved Links Widget gathers Saved Links (optionally filtered by your Saved Link Tags) and displays them as a list similar to a list of Recent Posts. You can control the number of Saved Links to show, the length of the description excerpt, control display for different devices and a hyperlinked widget title for the feed.

#### 2. Link Roundups Widgets (since 0.3)

The Link Roundups Widget shows the most recent Link Roundup(s), which can be limited to a category. You can control the number of Link Roundups to show, the category to limit to (at present must be a single category, so use nested categories for multiple), control display for different devices and a hyperlinked widget title above the headline (i.e. "Latest Digest")
